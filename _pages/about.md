Hello! I am Zhixuan Chen.

I am a senior CS student at University of Michigan. Previously I worked with Prof. Jingwen Hu to develop a desktop app that is used to manipulate 3D parametric human body models. I am now working on ERchat (an ER training simulation tool) in the LifelongLearning Lab directed by Prof. Xu Wang. My areas of interest include broad topics in Human-Computer Interaction, such as UI design, human-AI collaboration, application of interactive technologies in healthcare, etc.
