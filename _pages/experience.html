  <li>
    <strong>3D Parametric Human Body Model App</strong>, <em>Supervisor: Prof. Jingwen Hu</em>
  </li>
  <p>
    The app is intended to help UMTRI researchers manipulate 3D parametric human body models. Core features include adjusting models by changing related parameters, comparing two models by aligning corresponding parts and exporting an adjusted model into a file. <a href="/images/model-app.png">[Image Preview]</a> <a href="https://github.com/shczx/3d-human-model-app">[GitHub]</a>
